            <h2>Eid</h2>
            <div class="divGridStyling">
                <p class="paragraphStyle">
                        Eid is a significant celebration for Muslims, marked by two main festivals: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Eid al-Fitr, which concludes the holy month of Ramadan, begins with a special prayer service, where people dress in new clothes and greet each other with "Eid Mubarak." Families come together to enjoy festive meals and give to charity, emphasizing the spirit of generosity. Eid al-Adha, or Bakrid, commemorates Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son, starting with prayers and the ritual sacrifice of an animal. The meat is distributed among family, friends, and those in need, reinforcing the values of sharing and community. Both Eids are celebrated with joy, featuring delicious foods and a sense of unity, as people from various backgrounds often join in the festivities.
