            <h2> History</h2>
          
            <p class="paragraphStyle">Kerala has been inhabited for thousands of years. Its spices attracted traders from the Roman Empire, Greece, and Arabia, making it an important trade center.
            From around the 1st century CE, the Chera dynasty ruled Kerala. They promoted trade and cultural exchange. In the late 15th century, Portuguese explorers, including Vasco da Gama, arrived, marking the start of European influence.
            Following the Portuguese, the Dutch and then the British took control. The British created the princely states of Travancore and Cochin, transforming local agriculture and economy by focusing on cash crops.
            Kerala played a key role in Indiaâ€™s fight for independence. In 1956, Kerala was formed when Travancore and Cochin merged. Since then, it has become known for high literacy rates, good healthcare, and progressive social policies. Today, Kerala is celebrated for its cultural diversity and natural beauty.</p>
